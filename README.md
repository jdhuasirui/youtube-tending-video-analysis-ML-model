## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
All the libriaries used in this project should be included in Anaconda distribution of Python. It can be run with Python 3.0 or newer version. 

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
As a Data Analyst working in media industry. I'm always fascinated by YouTube, the biggest video site in the world. With tens of thousand of videos uploaded everyday, YouTube has managed to find the best videos and recommend relevant videos to different people at scale.
The questions I'm exploring in this project include:
1. Which categories have the most trending videos?
2. How long does it take for the video to be trending?
3. Can we build a machine learning to predict the video views only using quantitative variables?

## File Description <a name="file_description"></a>
- US_category_id.json: json file for the category id and category name
- USvideos.csv: csv file for the YouTube trending videos data
- udacity_data_science_project_1_youtube.ipynb: Notebook to conduct the data analysis
